=============================================================================
    UUP-EWS - Microsoft Exchange Web Service (EWS) Library
=============================================================================

Notice: The bundled WSDL and XSD-files in config directory might need to be 
        replaced to match the exchange server running in your organization. 

        When updating WSDL, remember to also re-generate the PHP classes in
        source/UUP/Exchange/Types

** Update WSDL/XSD files:

    Download service, message and types definitions from the exchange server by running:

        bash$> for f in services.wsdl messages.xsd types.xsd; do \
                    curl -v --ntlm --user user@example.com \
                            https://server.example.com/ews/$f > config/$f
               done

    Append service definition at end of config/services.wsdl. Replace server.example.com
    with the actual exchange server to provide default host:

        <wsdl:service name="ExchangeServices">
          <wsdl:port name="ExchangeServicePort" binding="tns:ExchangeServiceBinding">
            <soap:address location="https://server.example.com/ews/exchange.asmx" />
          </wsdl:port>
        </wsdl:service> 

** Update PHP classes:

    1. Use the bundled script to generate PHP classes from WSDL. Requires suggested 
       composer package wsdl2phpgenerator to be installed first:

       bash$> composer require wsdl2phpgenerator/wsdl2phpgenerator
       bash$> php bin/generate.php

    2. Download the CLI version of wsdl2phpgenerator, then generate the PHP classes
       from the WSDL file in the config directory:

       bash$> php ~/wsdl2phpgenerator.phar -i config/services.wsdl \
                        -o source/UUP/Exchange/Types -n "UUP\\Exchange\\Types" \
                        --noIncludes --constructorNull --createAccessors
